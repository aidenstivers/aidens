# Nano Documentation

## Notes on Nano
- most basic way to store human-readable textual info
- we'll use plain text to modify the programs we'll be installing later
- nano is modeless
- nano messages appear at the bottom of the screen with its command menu


- I created and saved several files to play around with commands
- I copied the commands from `^G` which I found helpful
- I viewed additional tutorials on nano on YT
- Overall, I was intimidated to use a text editor but found it was easier than I thought it would be
