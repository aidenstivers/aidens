# GitHub and Markdown Documentation

GitHub
- I created a `GitHub account`
- I created a *Repository*
- I began creating files **in the repository**

Markdown
- I'm learning basic Markdown using the Markdown Cheat Sheet
[Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- It reminds me a lot of `HTML` which I kind of learned the basics of in my **Tumblr** era
